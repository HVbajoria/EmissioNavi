 ## Problem Statement
The transportation and supply industry faces significant challenges related to carbon emissions and environmental sustainability. To address these issues, there is a need for a software solution that empowers individuals and organizations to calculate and mitigate their CO2 emissions effectively. The software should aim to solve the following problems:

1. **Lack of Awareness:**
   Many individuals and businesses are unaware of the environmental impact of their daily commutes or shipments. There is a lack of accessible tools to quantify and visualize the CO2 emissions associated with transportation choices.

2. **Difficulty in Calculating Emissions:**
   Calculating CO2 emissions from daily commutes, whether by public transport, car, or bike, can be a complex and time-consuming task. Existing tools may not be user-friendly or readily available.

3. **Uncertainty in Shipment Emissions:**
   Businesses often struggle to estimate the carbon footprint of their shipments accurately. This leads to challenges in implementing sustainable supply chain practices and meeting environmental goals.

4. **Lack of Guidance for Emission Reduction:**
   Once users identify their emissions, they may not know how to reduce them effectively. There is a need for guidance and suggestions on adopting eco-friendly transportation options and supply chain strategies.

5. **Limited Global Emission Insights:**
   Understanding the broader picture of CO2 emissions across the globe is essential for making informed decisions. However, access to comprehensive, up-to-date data and visualizations is limited.

6. **Difficulty in Comparing Features:**
   Users may find it challenging to compare different transportation options or shipment methods in terms of their environmental impact. Clear, user-friendly visualizations are needed to facilitate these comparisons.

In light of these challenges, the proposed software aims to provide a comprehensive solution that enables users to calculate, visualize, and reduce their CO2 emissions related to transportation and supply chain activities. By addressing these problems, the software will contribute to a more sustainable future for the transportation and supply industry.
